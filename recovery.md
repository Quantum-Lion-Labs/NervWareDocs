# Relink Mod Data to Existing Mod
If you've lost your Unity project for your mods, wiped your OS install, or just accidentally deleted a mod data asset, you can get it back with the recovery tool. This tool only works if you're the creator of the mod. This will not recover actual project files (yet..).

## Mod Data Recovery Window
To open the recovery window, go to the menu bar -> NervWare -> Recover Mod Data from ModID. This will open the Mod Data Recovery Window:

## Locating a ModID
Head to your mod's Mod.IO page, and look at the right sidebar. The ModID will be listed on the right panel.

Copy that ID, and enter it into the recovery window's `Mod ID` field. Then click `Try Recover Mod Data`. If successful, you will have your mod data asset restored!
